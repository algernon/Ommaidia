To go with my [keyboard][model01], I want to build a trackball that is tailored
to me, and my habits and nuances. For now, it goes under the working title of
`Ommatidia`, because of its relation to the Keyboardio [Model 01][model01], and
because of the optical sensor within it.

There isn't much here yet, as I am nowhere near even starting: I know nothing of
hardware, don't have the tools, and don't even know what I need. This is just a
place where I can note down ideas. A raw journal which I will - from time to
time - turn into [blog posts][a:trackball].

See [journal.md](journal.md) for the raw goodness.
