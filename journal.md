This is not how it all started. It all started with a
[picture][imgur:ltrac-wood], and then some [brain
dumping][m:ommatidia-beginning]. I put the idea aside after [writing a blog
post][a:trackball-quest] about it. But last night, when I was casually browsing
around, half asleep, I failed a saving throw as we say it. Having failed it, I
had no other choice, but to pursue the idea further, and that's how the first
sketch was born:
